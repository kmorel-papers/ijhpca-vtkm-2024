\section{Conclusion}

%\assign{Ken}

Although they were anomalous a decade ago, GPUs and accelerators have become a staple of HPC hardware and are now used in over $1/3$ of the top 500 fastest supercomputers in the world.\footnote{\url{https://top500.org/lists/top500/2023/11/}}
Efficient use of these accelerators is critical for good performance on HPC systems, and \vtkm provides this functionality for scientific visualization.

Moreover, the ECP has been instrumental in making \vtkm available on today's GPU-reliant exascale machines.
Many challenges were overcome with porting and integrating the software, and we are proud to have helped application scientists better analyze, explore, and understand their data.
We anticipate the use of \vtkm in high-performance visualization software to be even more critical as HPC continues to evolve.
