\section{Conclusion}

GPUs and other accelerators have become a staple of HPC.
Although they were anomalous a decade ago, GPUs are now featured on over $1/3$ of the top 500 fastest supercomputers,\footnote{\url{https://top500.org/lists/top500/2023/11/}} and that number is rising.
Efficient use of these accelerators is critical for good performance on HPC systems, and VTK-m provides this functionality for scientific visualization.

ECP has been instrumental in making VTK-m available on today's Exascale machines.
Many challenges were overcome with porting and integrating the software, and we are proud to have helped application scientists analyze, explore, and understand their data.
We anticipate the use of VTK-m in high performance visualization software to be even more critical as HPC machines evolve.
