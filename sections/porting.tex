\section{Porting Challenges}

Although the pre-Exascale machines gave the VTK-m development team good experience porting to different processor architectures, the design of the Exascale machines Frontier and Aurora introduced new technical challenges.
This section reports the most major modifications of VTK-m to make it feasible to run on the Exascale hardware.

\ken{
  Each subsection should be roughly 1/3 page.
  (1 + 1/3 page total.)
  The subsection should start with a paragraph defining the problem/motivation.
  The following paragraph should give an overview of the approach.
  The remaining paragraphs can go into technical challenges that were encountered and how they were addressed.
