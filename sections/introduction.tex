%The Exascale Computing Project (ECP) brought high-performance computing to the next milestone of capacity computing.\hank{I do not understand the preceding sentence.  Capability?  And we already had HPC.  How did ECP bring HPC?}
As its name would imply, the goal of the Exascale Computing Project (ECP) was to build and make practical the world's first Exascale high-performance computers.
Although this goal was nominally to stand up computers capable of a billion billion ($10^{18}$) floating point operations per second, this advancement required a revolution in both hardware and software.
Pivotal to this advancement was the adoption of GPU processors from a variety of vendors as the primary computing engine.
These GPUs provided an unmatched computational throughput relative to the power they consume, albeit at the cost of greater code complexity.

Scientific simulations running on exascale supercomputers can produce data sets of unprecedented
scale, and
visualization and analysis approaches are frequently used to understand the resulting
data and promote discovery.
%
That said, the scale of the data produced by simulations on exascale computers requires
the visualization and analysis approaches to themselves utilize significant computation.
%
Most commonly, this computation is done using the same supercomputer and hardware that produced
the data in the first place.

VTK-m is a software library that makes it possible to process data sets from exacale computers
by implementing classic scientific visualization algorithms redesigned for heavily threaded environments like GPUs.
VTK-m also provides a framework that simplifies the implementation of new algorithms and provides a porting layer to work across multiple processor types.
At the inception of ECP, VTK-m was the byproduct of a research project.
ECP provided the investment to promote VTK-m to production software.
This software that now serves as the underlying visualization implementation across all ECP.
VTK-m is currently used by ParaView, VisIt, and Ascent to execute visualization algorithms on Exascale platforms and others using GPU processing.

This paper provides an overview of the main challenges encountered to make visualization available at the Exascale.
It begins with a brief overview of the VTK-m framework.
It then discuss the largest porting challenges encountered during ECP as the hardware for the final Exascale machines differed dramatically from the pre-Exascale machines.
This is followed by a summary of the performance of VTK-m on the Exascale hardware.
Finally, the paper concludes with a discussion on the software engineering required to integrate VTK-m into usable visualization tools and successes with using VTK-m to solve problems in real science applications.
This includes porting challenges, performance testing and improvement, integration with other ECP software technologies, and the support of ECP applications.
