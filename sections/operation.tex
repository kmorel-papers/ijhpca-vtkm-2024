\section{Operation on Exascale Hardware}

The ECP Exascale platforms are unique in many ways.
The previous section summarized the major software development changes to prepare for the platform.
In this section we discuss further technical challenges in compiling and executing VTK-m.

\ken{
  Each subsection should be roughly 1/2 page.
  (1 page total.)
  The subsection shold start with a brief overview of the system, focusing on unique features.
  The following paragraphs should describe a challenge and then discuss how the challenge was addressed.
  Some examples include long compile times, errors for function pointer calls, compiler errors.
  The section should end with a paragraph summarizing the current state of VTK-m on the system.

\subsection{Frontier}
The first system delivered under the ECP program, Frontier, is also the first system to break the exascale barrier with a score on the Linpack benchmark of 1.19 exaflops. Frontier is an AMD-based system with 9,472 AMD Epyc CPUs (606,208 cores) and 37,888 AMD MI250X GPUs (8,335,360 cores). The system is organized into 74 racks, consisting of 64 blades with 2 nodes each. A node consists of a single CPU and 4 GPUs with 4 TB of RAM.

Porting to a new system that is under active development brings many challenges. When the first pre-exascale development systems for Frontier came online, VTK-m frequently broke the compiler. At one point in the build, test, release cycle for the compilers, AMD had the VTK-m team building the compilers from bleeding-edge source to help debug the crashes. As the compilers stabilized, the team discovered another issue: compile times that were measured in centuries. And thus, the cycle would begin anew. Along the way there were many issues that required solutions from AMD, Kokkos, and the VTK-m teams. Some examples are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Compiler Errors
    \item The Optimizer infinite looping - In addition to compiler fixes, the VTK-m source was broken into smaller units to reduce template instantiation
    \item Parallel Sorting being Single-Threaded - Kokkos hadn't accounted for VTK-m workloads that used integral types (for example, sorting keys). A simple fix provide a 12x speedup in these workloads.
    \item Function pointers not supported on AMD GPUs - VTK-m was re-written over several months to remove all calls through function pointers
\end{itemize}
Currently, a full build of VTK-m with tests and benchmarks can be completed on Frontier in under 20 minutes.
