\section{Interfacing with Applications}

\ken{
  Each subsection should be up to 2/3 pages plus have images up to 1/2 page.
  (3.5 pages total.)
  The section should start with a layperson overview of what the domain problem is, what scientists are doing to study the problem.
  The section should then explain how visualization fits in to help.
  Explain the technical solution of how VTK-m was integrated into the system and describe the final result.
  The section may repeat for multiple things that were done.
  For example the fusion reactor could first talk about in situ images and then Poincar\'{e} plots.
  The laser wakefields could talk about deliver of in situ images via Ascent and then about the customized particle advection.
  The final section will be a little different in that it will iterate over multiple science domains.
